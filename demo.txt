Deployment Workflow

✅ Technology Stack (Confirmed)
Component	Technology
AI Agent	Python + Gemini CLI
CI/CD	GitHub Actions
Deployment	Google Cloud Run
Database	Automated via gcloud CLI
Sample App	Node.js/Express
Developer Access	CLI + Web Console
🚀 Two Easy Access Methods
Option 1: CLI (Power Users)
bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/your-org/agentic-ai-serverless.git
./scripts/setup.sh
# Analyze and deploy
python agent/main.py analyze --code-path ./app
python agent/main.py deploy --auto
Option 2: Web Console (Visual Interface)
bash
# Start web UI
python web/app.py
# Open browser → http://localhost:5000
# Click "Analyze" → Review recommendations → Click "Deploy"
Option 3: GitHub Actions (Fully Automated)
bash
# Just push code
git push origin main
# AI agent automatically:
# ✓ Analyzes code
# ✓ Recommends infrastructure
# ✓ Deploys to Cloud Run
# ✓ Sets up database
# ✓ Posts deployment summary

💡 Key Features
1. AI-Driven Intelligence
🧠 Analyzes code complexity → recommends CPU/memory
🗄️ Detects database usage → provisions automatically
🔒 Scans for secrets → suggests Secret Manager
💰 Estimates costs before deployment
2. Zero-Touch Deployment
⚡ Push to GitHub → automatic deployment
🤖 AI agent reviews every commit
🔄 Automated rollback on failures
📊 Deployment summaries as PR comments
3. Developer-Friendly
🎯 One-command setup: ./scripts/setup.sh
🚀 One-command deploy: python agent/main.py deploy --auto
📝 Clear, actionable recommendations
🐛 Comprehensive error messages
4. Production-Ready
🔐 Secure secret management (Secret Manager)
🗃️ Automated database provisioning (gcloud CLI)
❤️ Health checks and monitoring
📉 Cost optimization
